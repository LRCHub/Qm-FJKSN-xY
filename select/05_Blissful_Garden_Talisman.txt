Round round we go in search 4 a new beginning,
A million times 2 1 i feel like giving up
Prayin' 4 the time, r wars were just indifference,
The solutions out there somewhere
So tight i'm all wound up heart beatin' like a drum,
Won't u just lead me 2 your

Blissful garden (garden of love)
Where love life r so serene,
Show me your blissful garden (garden of love)
Wake up dream

Love or tragedy, 2 fallacious heroes,
Cross that slender line between right from wrong,
Soon we're bound 2 find the prize 4 r production,
It was always out there somewhere so tight

So tight, i'm all wound up heart beatin' like a drum,
Won't u just lead me 2 your

Blissful garden (garden of love)
Where love life r so serene,
Show me your blissful garden (garden of love)
Wake up dream
